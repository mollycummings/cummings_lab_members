# Tasks That New Cummings Lab Members Need To Complete

Welcome to the Cummings lab! 

Before you begin working with us, there are a lot of fun modules you need to take. These short-courses will impart various bits of wisdom that will be essential to know during your time in the lab. 

These modules fall under two categories: animal welfare and lab safety. This document lists the things you must complete in each category before starting working in the lab.


## Animal Welfare Stuff: IACUC

IACUC is the governing body that oversees animal welfare on campus. Before you begin handling animals, you’ll need to learn a little more about fish handling and care from the IACUC people.

- Go to http://www.utexas.edu/research/rsc/iacuc/
- From the Animal Research menu on the left, choose Mandatory Training for Working with Animals
- Scroll down. Under Part 1 click on the Health Assessment Questionnaire for personnel Working with Research Animals and Other Hazards.
  - You will need some idea of your vaccination history for this. 
  - PI: Molly Cummings

  - When you’re done filling out the form, take a stroll over to SSB and drop it off with the nice people at HealthPoint.
- Go to https://spike.orsc.utexas.edu/ep2/ to access the training modules. You'll sign in with your UT EID and password.
- Under the eProtocol drop-down menu in upper left part of screen choose AALAS Learning Library

You can check your training record in the eProtocol drop-down menu under Investigator then selecting Training Record.


## Lab Safety Stuff: EH&S

EH&S is the body that oversees lab safety on campus. Even if you aren’t running around the lab mixing acids and bases or pipetting RNA, you still need to complete the following modules in case you accidentally wander into one of the molecular labs and can’t find your way out.

To kick things off, you'll need to register for [UTlearn](https://utlearn.utexas.edu) using the link emailed to you by EHS. If they haven’t emailed you, you can contact them directly and they will send you the link. Follow prompts to register, and then you can sign in to take the courses below.

- Find your way to http://ehs.utexas.edu/training/lab-training-requirements.php
- Complete the following modules:
  - OH 101
  - OH 201
  - OH 202
  - OH 207
- Ask Sarah <a href="mailto:sarah.price@utexas.edu">here</a> to take you on a grand tour of the lab space. We call this OH 102.
- Schedule a time to put out a fire (!) by logging into [UTLearn](https://utlearn.utexas.edu/) and search for class FF 205 (EID is required to sign up for the class) .

- Finally, the cherry on top: email your name and EID to Sarah by clicking <a href="mailto:sarah.price@utexas.edu">here</a> and let her know you’ve completed your arduous journey.
